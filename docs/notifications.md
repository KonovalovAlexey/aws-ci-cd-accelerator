![Microsoft Teams and Slack Notifications](../docs/pic/codepipeline_events.png)

* `CloudWatch Event rules` watches for a specific type of event from `CodeBuild/CodePipeline`. When a matching event comes in, the rule routes it to one or more targets(`SNS topic`) which trigger the notification lambda function. 
* If you define one of the notification methods, you get a notification there.
