## Introduction

AWS native CI/CD accelerator is a product that brings a unified CI/CD approach with testing best practices out of the box and helps to manage infrastructure with a focus on code quality and security. In addition, it absorbs EPAMâ€™s years of experience in designing and implementing CI/CD solutions for numerous clients across different business domains and countries.

Key points:

* is fully automated
* follows industry best practices for CI/CD and testing
* has minimum time for implementation
* serves as a secured gateway for infrastructure management
* offers cost-effective pipelines
* has integrations with major code hosting platforms
* does not require a separate experienced team for support
