## Contributing

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/epam/aws-ci-cd-accelerator/issues) is the preferred channel for bug reports, feature requests and submitting pull requests.

You can also submit pull requests with changes. GitHub has a great guide on that: [Forking Projects](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

## Semantic Pull Requests

To generate changelog, Pull Requests or Commits must have semantic and must follow conventional specs below:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation and examples
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `ci:` for changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore:` for updates that do not apply to the above, such as dependency updates.
